# Linker
This lab implements a two-pass linker by C++. 

Assume a target machine with properties: 
1) word addressable 
2) addressable memory of 512 words
3) each valid word is represented by an integer smaller than ten thousand. 

The input contains a sequence of tokens, including symbols, integers, and instruction type characters, and tokens of a section may not be only one line. 
Also, it handles all errors/ warnings, such as syntax error and space limit.
